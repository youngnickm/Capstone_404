# Capstone_404
This branch contains all code related Embedded Systems.

To ensure the robot is functioning correctly, both of the python files included in this repository need to be on the Raspberry Pi in their own directory and the robot will need to be connected to a hotspot or WiFi outside of TAMU-Visitor WiFi. Additionally, "advertisement.py" will need to be set up to execute on startup/power on. After completing this step, the BLE hosting will work allowing for the device to connect to the Raspberry Pi, the robot will have the ability to receive signals and move motors via the script's signal processing capabilities, and pathfinding will be operational through Firebase collecting and downloading mp3 files.
