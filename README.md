# Capstone_404
This repository contains all code and information related to our project: Voice Controlled Robot.

Each branch contains files related to the branch's title:
App - Includes all code and files necessary to download the application to the user's mobile device.

Embedded - Includes all code required to set up the BLE host, download and process audio files from Firebase, and the overall function of the robot.

STT - Includes all code used to train the STT along with a download link to the model file that is called by the Embedded Systems. *All audio files could not be uploaded due to the 25MB limitation for each file although the Librispeech dataset automatically downloads if the script detects that it is not present. Note that the downloaded dataset will not include the 5,000 custom command voice lines.

Presentation - Includes all status updates and final presentation for the semester.

Instructions and information on running/using code can be found in each specific branch's README file.
